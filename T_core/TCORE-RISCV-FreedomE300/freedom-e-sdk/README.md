# README #

This repository is just a copy-modified version from the original freedom-e-sdk (https://github.com/sifive/freedom-e-sdk/tree/v1_0).

The purpose of this repository is to use a reduced version of freedom-e-sdk to make it enough to be used by Terasic T-Core FPGA Board to show the simple demo and keep it stable.
