# README #

This repository is just a copy-modified version from the original sirv-e-sdk (from https://github.com/SI-RISCV/e200_opensource).

The purpose of this repository is to use a reduced version of sirv-e-sdk to make it enough to be used by Terasic T-Core FPGA Board to show the simple demo and keep it stable.
